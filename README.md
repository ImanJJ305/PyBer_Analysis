# PyBer_ City/Driver_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis is to display the relationship between drivers and the fares received in varying city types. This information is intended to assist the  team at the PyBer rides haring app improve access to their ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


## Results
### Findings
    The ride sharing data captured diplays the disparity between the fares earned by drivers in urban cities in relation to those in rural areas. We can see that the total number of drivers in rural areas, 78, is low; however, the average fare for those drivers, $34.62, is high in comparison to those in urban areas where the number of drivers is 2,405 and the average fare is 24.52. The data for dirvers in suburban areas appears to be pretty average in comparison to the two other city types. 
    
## Summary
### Recomendations Based On The Data
    - It is recommended that fares are increased in urban areas as the number of drivers is high and the average fare per ride is fairly low.
    - Another recommendation, in an effort to increate the wages/fares earned for drivers in urban areas, would be to reduce the number of drivers in the area. This would result in drivers earning more as there would be less drivers in these areas.
